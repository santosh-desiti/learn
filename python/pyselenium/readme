python it is nearly impossible to find a exit handler. We have signal, atexit and finally blocks which would be helpful in cleaning up initialization like DB
- Could not find anything which handles "Process finished with exit code -1", still need to search
Explored the connection pool which is lot safer than the regular connection opening and closing it - https://pynative.com/psycopg2-python-postgresql-connection-pooling/

pytest test_appselenium.py --alluredir ./reports
allure serve ./reports/

Things to note: Remove pytest-allure-adaptor if installed
All the classnames and method names should start or end with "test_"
